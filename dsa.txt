Datastructure and Algorithms:
	Logic buildings
	Complexity analysis
		Time Complexity
			c < log log n < n ^1/3 < n ^1/2 < n < n log n < n^2 < n^2 log n < n^3 < n^3 log n < ...
		Space Complexity
Datastructure:
	It is used to store the data

Algorithms:
	It is the process of data
	Searching Algorithms:
		1. Linear Algorithms : 
			* It is unsorted array.
			* Which will check one by one.
		2. Binary Search Algorithms:
			* It should be sorted array.
			* It will search in middle then it will check whether is it present in left or right half based on the first condition result.
			in java we can use inbuilt functions to search
			Arrays.binarySearch(array, item); --> Which will return the index.
			Collections.binarySearch(list, item); --> it is used for list and this also returns the index;
		In application if we used to check whether the data present or not then we will use contains keyword, to expplicitly search algo not required 
	Sorting Algorithms:
		Sorting algorithms is to re arrange the given elements in the array.
		Which is having different types of algorithms those are merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, Quick sort, selection sort, Tim sort.
		
		Merge sort is used as divide and conquer
