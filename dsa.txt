Datastructure and Algorithms:
	Logic buildings
	Complexity analysis
		Time Complexity
			c < log log n < n ^1/3 < n ^1/2 < n < n log n < n^2 < n^2 log n < n^3 < n^3 log n < ...
		Space Complexity
Datastructure:
	It is used to store the data

Algorithms:
	It is the process of data
	Searching Algorithms:
		1. Linear Algorithms : 
			* It is unsorted array.
			* Which will check one by one.
		2. Binary Search Algorithms:
			* It should be sorted array.
			* It will search in middle then it will check whether is it present in left or right half based on the first condition result.
